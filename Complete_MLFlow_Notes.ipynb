    "# ✅ **MLflow Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MLflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "* MLflow is an **open-source tool** to manage the complete **machine learning lifecycle**.\n",
    "* It helps with **experiment tracking, reproducibility, model packaging, and deployment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tracking**\n",
    "   * Records experiments: code, parameters, metrics, and output files.\n",
    "   * Helps compare different runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Projects**\n",
    "   * Organizes ML code for reuse and sharing.\n",
    "   * Uses a configuration file (`MLproject`) to define environment and entry points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Models**\n",
    "   * Standard format to save and use models.\n",
    "   * Supports multiple frameworks (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Registry**\n",
    "   * Central place to manage models.\n",
    "   * Provides version control, stage transitions (Staging → Production), and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logs and stores **parameters, metrics, artifacts, models**.\n",
    "* Makes experiments **reproducible**.\n",
    "* Works with **any ML/DL library**.\n",
    "* Easy to **deploy models** (REST API, Docker, cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train a model and log results with MLflow.  \n",
    "2. Compare different experiments in the MLflow UI.  \n",
    "3. Package the project for reuse.  \n",
    "4. Register the model in the Model Registry.  \n",
    "5. Deploy the model for production use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manages the **entire ML pipeline** in one place.  \n",
    "* Ensures **collaboration and version control**.  \n",
    "* **Framework-agnostic** (works with any ML library).  \n",
    "* Scales from local experiments to cloud deployment.\n",
